Maze solver and generator for the browser

Solves mazes with breadth-first, depth-first, and A* (WIP) search, displays path from start to end

Can generate mazes with a radomized form of depth-first traversal, Prim's algorithm, and Kruskal's algorithm

Users can create maze themselves or use a randomized depth-first search to automatically generate a maze and then edit it as they wish
